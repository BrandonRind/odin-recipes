    <h3>Juicy breaded chicken cutlets</h3>
        <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken.</p>
        <p>Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>

        </ul>

            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes.</li>
